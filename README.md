# MapForAction

MapForAction was created to map out instances of police brutality and racial injustice while giving users the tools to help take action.

It was created for the NYC Coders Hack for #blacklivesmatter

## What's Next

We are continuing to support MapForAction! 

We've recently brought the app to our Hacktivist group for user testing before we let others know about the app. 

### What We're Working On
Adding Emails to users after their incident is approved.

CSS Fixes.

Responsive Design.
